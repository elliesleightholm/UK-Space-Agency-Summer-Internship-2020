# RESEARCH INTERN - S&AO

8 week Summer Research Internship with the UK Space Agency and S&AO. Placement Student as part of the Space Placements in INdustry (SPIN) Scheme 2020: supported by the Satellite Applications Catapult and managed by the UK Space Agency.

Exploring sensors and atmospheric science. Currently developing a module using Python to take FMCW Doppler Radar data and visualise this with user capabilities. Also exploring the scattering of electro-magnetic radiation at hydrometeors as well as terminal fall velocity.

Certain explanations or code may be missing due to the confidentiality of the project I am working on.
