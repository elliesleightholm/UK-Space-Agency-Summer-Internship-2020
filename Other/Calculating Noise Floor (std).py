# We want to edit the colour code - we seek to find the average noise floor and the standard deviation of
# variability. We therefore take a dataset that has no transients and from a spectra where there are no non-noise peaks
# to do this we delete all the columns that are assigned to transients and then find a row that has no non-noise peaks

# We have dropped all of the transient columns from our dataset.

# We compute the mean power spectra and standard deviation:
print(computed_df.mean(axis=1))
print(computed_df.std(axis=1))

# 5756th Spectra gives spectra with no peaks other than noise power - after calculating we know that the average
# noise floor is -107.304882 and the standard deviation is 1.176044 so this is the range we will set our colour range
# to for our graphs. This allows no noise spectra to be plotted

# We use this and plot a 3D Graph and observe the findings
